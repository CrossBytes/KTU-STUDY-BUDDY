*SGPA Calculator*
SGPA is the grade point average that is determined at the conclusion of each semester. it uses a 10-point rating system. Even though there are other websites that offer SGPA calculation services, we are including one of our own, since our main intention is to provide students with access to all the tools they need to 
excel in academics in a single convenient location.

*Notes*
This area contains study materials organised by department, semester and module. they are accessible in pdf format and can be downloaded as well.

*Syllabus*
This field provides the syllabus for each subject in each semester for all the respective departments.

*PYQs*
Here, we offer a collection of previous year question papers of KTU, ordered by semester and by course to familiarize students with the types of questions that may be asked. This helps them to prepare accordingly.

## This website is solely dedicated for academics as well as a motivation for students. It acts as a boost to their interest to study and achieve good grades.
